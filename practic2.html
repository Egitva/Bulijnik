	<h2 class='upper2'>PROLOGUE</h2>
	<h3>
	Two households, both alike in dignity <br>
(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene), <br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-marked love<br>
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,<br>
Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;<br>
The which, if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
